4) It has 5 sections i.e Home, Transaction List, Adds/Removes a transaction, Gets a graphical view of the transactions, and the User Profile
5) The home section has the following functionalities:

6) The transaction section has the following functionalities:

   6.4) One can also filter all transactions based on the transaction category and whether the transaction was an income or expense.
   6.5) The transaction filters can be removed also, thus getting all of the transactions again.

   amount, its category and its description. Each page is assigned a color based on the transaction type.
8) The graphical view of the transactions allows us to get a bar view and pie chart view of a cumulation of all the transactions that have occurred this now.
